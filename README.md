# taskPlayer

This is an import from the taskPlayer module I developed in the context of the MACSI project. 
It is meant to be used with the iCub robot (reality and simulation).

It reads from one/multiple trajectory files, saved by the module taskRecorder.
Each file contains an arm trajectory recorded by demonstration.
TaskPlayer simply reads the trajectory and executes it when asked.

It works with:
- WoZ
- TaskRecorder
- TaskRecorderGUI
